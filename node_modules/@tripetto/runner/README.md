### Summary
This package contains the Tripetto form runner library that is used to create form UIs (so the part used by respondents to fill out a form). The library handles all the complicated stuff that comes into play when running forms and surveys with advanced logic capabilities. The goal here is to make it easy for developers to create awesome UIs (using any UI framework or library) that can run Tripetto forms without having to reinvent the wheel every time.

### Features
- Takes a [JSON form definition](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/builder/api/interfaces/IDefinition/) (created with the [Tripetto form builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tripetto/builder)) and parses it into a [virtual finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_finite-state_machine) that handles all the complex logic and response collection during the execution of the form;
- [Export API](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/api/library/modules/Export/) for exporting collected form data in various formats;
- [Import API](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/api/library/modules/Import/) for preloading (prefilling) forms;
- Supports [pausing and resuming](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/guides/pause-resume/) forms;
- Optional [form spam protection](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/guides/spam-protection/).

### Package contents
- [Library](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/api/library/) to build form runner UIs (ES5, ESM, and UMD bundles included);
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html) typings (type declarations) for optimal TypeScript experience;
- [Locales](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/guides/l10n/#locale) with localized number and date/time formats.

## 🏃 Stock runners
Stock runners are full-featured runner UIs built with this form runner library and maintained by the Tripetto team. Stock runners are the easiest and most convenient way to run a Tripetto form. They provide a seamless experience out of the box and are very easy to use and implement. The following stock runners are available:

- **Autoscroll runner** - Fluently presents one question at a time [🕹️ Demo](https://tripetto.gitlab.io/runners/autoscroll/) [📖 Docs](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/faces/autoscroll/)
- **Chat runner** - Presents all questions and answers as a chat [🕹️ Demo](https://tripetto.gitlab.io/runners/chat/) [📖 Docs](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/faces/chat/)
- **Classic runner** - Presents question fields in a traditional form format [🕹️ Demo](https://tripetto.gitlab.io/runners/classic/) [📖 Docs](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/faces/classic/)
- **Classic Fluent UI runner** - Classic runner using Fluent UI [🕹️ Demo](https://tripetto.gitlab.io/runners/classic-fluentui/) [📖 Docs](https://tripetto.com/sdk/docs/runner/stock/api/classic-fluentui/)
